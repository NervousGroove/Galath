# ☕ Cross-platform
Galath is compatible with various operating systems, such as:
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

# 🐍 Developed with Python
Although Galath is dedicated to creating applications using web technology, Galath was not created with a 100% web technology/language. Galath was developed entirely with Python.

# 🌾 Light and Fast
Unlike other existing frameworks of the same genre, such as Electron and NWjs, Galath is extremely light and fast, since it is not based on Chromium, and has its own engine, making everything lighter, safer and faster.

# 🤖 100% Secure
Galath is the most secure framework for creating applications using web technologies, hiding the source code completely from the user, making it impossible for other users to copy or even see it. It is an innovative technology.

# ✨ Customizing Your Program
Notice that one of the files included in Galath is the "package.spike" file. You can change some of the information in this file such as the application name, author, and version. All these changes will impact your application, for example, if you change the application name, the window title will be the application name.

# ☄️ How to Encrypt Additional Files
With Galath it is extremely easy to encrypt files, the file "index.html" is encrypted by default, but additional files are at your discretion. To encrypt additional files, create a file called "config.spike" (in the Galath folder) and edit this file, adding the names of the files you want to encrypt (separated by a comma).
Another thing that is possible with Galath is to change the file names. But it's not a simple change, with the filename change technique Galath configures the new name and adapts it to work normally and correctly, for example, if you change the name of a file called "style.css" to "style.glt", this file will no longer be functional and will cause errors, but if you do it with Galath, it will work normally. To do this, just create a file called "ren.spike" in the Galath folder, and add the following structure:
```text
ren(old_filename) => new_filename
```
Notice that in the first parentheses you have the word "old_filename" (without quotes). You must replace this word with the name of the existing file it will rename, and in the other quotes there is the word "new_filename", in which you must put the new name of this file. Let's say there is a file called "main.js", and I want to rename it to "test.tkl", it will look like this:
```text
ren("main.js") => test.tkl
```

# 🌐 Official Website
Galath has an official website, for new users to learn more about the capabilities of this framework. Remember, this website only has information and no Galath for download, the only way to download Galath is using GalathHub as mentioned above in the "How to Install" section.
