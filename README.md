# ☕ Cross-platform
Galath is compatible with various operating systems, such as:
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

# 🐍 Developed with Python
Although Galath is dedicated to creating applications using web technology, Galath was not created with a 100% web technology/language. Galath was developed entirely with Python.

# 🌾 Light and Fast
Unlike other existing frameworks of the same genre, such as Electron and NWjs, Galath is extremely light and fast, since it is not based on Chromium, and has its own engine, making everything lighter, safer and faster.

# 🤖 100% Secure
Galath is the most secure framework for creating applications using web technologies, hiding the source code completely from the user, making it impossible for other users to copy or even see it. It is an innovative technology.

# ✨ Customizing Your Program
Notice that one of the files included in Galath is the "package.spike" file. You can change some of the information in this file such as the application name, author, and version. All these changes will impact your application, for example, if you change the application name, the window title will be the application name.
