You can install Galath from Github or from GalathHub.

Downloading from Github, you will have to extract, and after extracting, realize that there will be several files, but you only need one of them, the "Galath.zip" file. When downloading from GalathHub you will only have the necessary files. In the Galath.zip file, when you extract it, notice that you will have 3 folders, one for each operating system, select yours and extract that particular folder. Now let's get started, here are the steps:

1. Move your project files (HTML, CSS, JS, JS, LS, TS) to the Galath folder (Which you extracted according to your operating system)

2. Run the "Encrypt" file

3. That's it! You can now use your program.
