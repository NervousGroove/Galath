# 🚀 Galath
Galath is a framework dedicated to all web technologies and languages, developed and maintained individually by SwankyNoob since 2023. Thanks to Galath you can develop desktop applications using any web language/technology, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LiveScript, TypeScript, SpellSpike, and Zig. 

# 📦 How to Install
You can install Galath from Github or from GalathHub. To download from Github just click "Download" and then "Download ZIP", from GalathHub just go to "http://galath.epizy.com/hub" and download GalathHub. We recommend installing from GalathHub, although Github may also work. Downloading from Github, you will have to extract, and after extracting, realize that there will be several files, but you only need one of them, the "Galath.zip" file. When downloading from GalathHub you will only have the necessary files. In the Galath.zip file, when you extract it, notice that you will have 3 folders, one for each operating system, select yours and extract that particular folder. Now let's get started, here are the steps:

1. Move your project files (HTML, CSS, JS, JS, LS, TS) to the Galath folder (Which you extracted according to your operating system)

2. Run the "Encrypt" file

3. That's it! You can now use your program.

# 🐍 Developed with Python
Although Galath is dedicated to creating applications using web technology, Galath was not created with a 100% web technology/language. Galath was developed entirely with Python.

# 🌾 Light and Fast
Unlike other existing frameworks of the same genre, such as Electron and NWjs, Galath is extremely light and fast, since it is not based on Chromium, and has its own engine, making everything lighter, safer and faster.

# 🤖 100% Secure
Galath is the most secure framework for creating applications using web technologies, hiding the source code completely from the user, making it impossible for other users to copy or even see it. It is an innovative technology.
